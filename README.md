# Puzzle

**Puzzle** is an OCaml library and Domain Specific Language
to solve puzzle and games using AI techniques.
It features a rich but simple specification language to describe problems
and a collection of solvers to solve them.

## Philosophy

This project's primary purpose is to be an educational project both from
the users and the implementers point of view.
Therefore, the code base is intended to be readable and extensively documented. We also try to maintain a reasonable balance between code simplicity and performances.

## References

Most algorithms and definitions are directly borrowed from the famous book [Artificial Intelligence, a modern approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) from Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. However, the code base takes some freedom regarding the exact implementation of the algorithms and features algorithms that are not presented in the book.
